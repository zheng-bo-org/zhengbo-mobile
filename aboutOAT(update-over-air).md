# The approach?
## Based on expo eas updates
```
The eas updates of expo is seems good for a startup app to use.
It got free plan and its enghout for startup app and Its able to use a custom server 
without payting to Expo if you dont want to pay for Expo.

OAT is buildin to the Expo SDK, so on the code level you dont need to do anything
but add some configuration files.
